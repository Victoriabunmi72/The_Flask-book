# THE FLASK BOOK TUTORIAL.

Flask is a micro framework for Python web development. A framework, in the
simplest terms, is a library or collection of libraries that aims to solve a part of a generic
problem instead of a complete specific one. When building web applications, there
are some problems that will always need to be solved, such as routing from URLs to
resources, inserting dynamic data into HTML, and interacting with an end user.

Flask is a micro framework because it implements only core functionality (including
routing) but leaves more advanced functionality (including authentication and
database ORMs) to extensions. The result of this is less initial setup for the first-time
user and more choice and flexibility for the experienced user. This is in contrast
with "fuller" frameworks, such as Django, which dictate their own ORM and authentication technologies.

As we'll discuss, our Hello World application in Flask can be written in only seven 
lines of code, with the entire application consisting of a single file. Does that sound 
good? Let's get going!
